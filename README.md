### ⚡️ Quick Tool Mentions (`@`)

![mention](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a80dd48-1d95-4938-b0d8-431c02ec2a53)

Quickly call any registered MCP tool during chat by typing `@toolname`.  
No need to memorize — just type `@` and pick from the list!

You can also control how tools are used with the new **Tool Choice Mode**:

- **Auto:** Tools are automatically called by the model when needed.
- **Manual:** The model will ask for your permission before calling any tool.
- **None:** Disables all tool usage.

Toggle modes anytime with the shortcut `⌘P`.

> This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the recommended package manager.

```bash
# If you don't have pnpm:
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Quick Start (Local Version) 🚀

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Create the environment variable file and fill in your .env values
pnpm initial:env # This runs automatically in postinstall, so you can usually skip it.

# 3. (Optional) If you already have PostgreSQL running and .env is configured, skip this step
pnpm docker:pg

# 4. Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# 5. Start the development server
pnpm dev

# 6. (Optional) Build & start for local production-like testing
pnpm build:local && pnpm start
# Use build:local for local start to ensure correct cookie settings
```


### Quick Start (Docker Compose Version) 🐳

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Create environment variable files and fill in the required values
pnpm initial:env # This runs automatically in postinstall, so you can usually skip it.

# 3. Build and start all services (including PostgreSQL) with Docker Compose
pnpm docker-compose:up

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to get started.

---

### Environment Variables

The `pnpm i` command generates a `.env` file. Add your API keys there
You only need to enter the keys for the providers you plan to use:
```dotenv
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=****
OPENAI_API_KEY=****
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=****
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=****
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api
AUTH_SECRET=
POSTGRES_URL=
FILE_BASED_MCP_CONFIG=false
```

for auth secret run `pnpx auth secret`

---

### MCP Server Setup

You can connect MCP tools via:

1. **UI Setup:** Go to http://localhost:3000/mcp and configure through the interface.
2. **Custom Logic:** Edit `./custom-mcp-server/index.ts` to implement your own logic, this also doesn't run on vercel or docker.
3. **File based for local dev:** make .mcp-config.json and put your servers in there. Only works in local dev, no docker or vercel env variable required. For example 
```jsonc
// .mcp-config.json
{
  "playwright":  {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
    ...
}
```
